    <p>How would I describe myself in one word? I would choose "explorer". After living in Toronto for the majority
        of
        my life, I decided to take the unprecedented step of moving to Vancouver for university. I've always been
        open
        to change and taking risks, but I will admit moving across the country was slightly extreme for me. However,
        I
        have come to admire and embrace the diverse people and experiences that have impacted me. Looking forward to
        the
        future, I am excited to see what is in store for me.

        Career-wise, my interests lie in tech. I love learning about egnabling business and entrepreneurship
        through technology. You will often find me learning about new programming concepts and creating my own
        applications.
        <br><br>
        In my spare time, I am an avid enthusiast of Ultimate Frisbee and a total foodie. Please feel free to do
        some
        exploring yourself and look through the site. You might also find a video of me during a ramen-eating
        competition (where I placed in the top 25% percentile).
