title: Part I AWS re:Invent 2019 Recap—It begins...

Was going into the 2019 AWS re:Invent conference without knowing anything related to AWS or cloud systems brilliant or stupid? A recap of a wild week and my personal takeaways. The first in an X-part series where I detail my escapades and cluelessness at the world's premier AWS event. 

### The adventure begins

I remember it was October of 2019 when my friend first brought up the idea of the AWS re:Invent Conference. He was a mentor and actually a previous ultimate frisbee coach of mine who had been in the technology industry for a few years. I at the time was just a clueless "computer science" student who had just learned about what computers actually were. 

Let me preface the fact that at that particular moment in my life, I had just learned what an operating system really was. Yes I actually did not know that there existed more operating systems other than Windows and MacOS. Also yes I was already a year into my combined CS degree. Looking back now, this just makes the fact that I even considered attending a technology conference even more questionable. 

As such, when the idea of attending AWS was first brought up, you can imagine my hesitation and doubtfulness towards attending. There were just a few small details to the trip that I had to consider:

- It was in Las Vegas
- It lasted an entire week
- A $1800 price tag (On a student budget? Are you crazy?)
- Money for travel and hotel 
- It was in Las Vegas
- I did not know what AWS was
- I had never attended a tech conference before
- It was in Las Vegas (And I'm not 21)

Quite negative reasons that leaned heavily towards reasons not to go wouldn't you agree? Contrast these to the reasons I came up with to go:

- I get to learn more about AWS (Whatever that is)
- I get to visit Vegas 
- I get to experience my first tech conference

At the end of the day, there were significantly more reasons for me NOT to go. Not only was the event way past what I could afford, but it also occurred near my exam times. If I were to attend, it would potentially clash with one of my finals. 

By November, the idea of AWS re:Invent was so far in the resesses of my mind that I was suprised when the same friend brought up the idea of attending once again. Now I don't know how the stars seemed to align to get to me Vegas, but I'm glad they did. After my exam schedule was released, I realized that there was conveniently one week where I had no finals—the exact week of AWS. On top of that, my friend also found a way for us to share flights and hotels during our stay. Now there was just the issue of the gigantic price tag for the actual event...which he also had a solution for.  

Pro-tip: There is actually a student discount for re:Invent attendees that is **significantly** lower than the regular ticket price. All we had to do was email the AWS organizers with student identification and we were ready to go. 

At this point, I didn't really have any more excuses to say no. The logistics of our trip lined up and once my friend bought our flight tickets, I knew that I was locked in. 

You have to remember that I was still clueless to what the event actually was—even after agreeing to attending. If I could sum it up to one analogy: it's like giving $1 000, 000 in cold hard cash to a baby. A trip to one of the world's premier tech conferences? It's such a golden opportunity to any developer, programmer, or tech geek. As a more experienced programmer and CS student now, I would gladly get on my knees and beg COVID to allow me another chance to attend an event like re:Invent again. 

However, I was none of those things in November of 2019. I held those wads of cash in my grubby infant hands and just stared. I watched hours of YouTube to just understand what cloud computing was. I thought I was a genius when I finally learned about SaSS, PaSS, and IaSS. I gave myself a pat on the back for uploading a image onto AWS S3. As you can see, it's all admittedly not all that impressive. 

Most of my November comprised of my half-assed attempts to master AWS before the conference. Were they effective you ask? Did I feel prepared for the conference now? Nope. 

It may just be me, but when I learn about technology, I like to be hands-on. I like using terminal for my computing tasks and seeing source code. That approach didn't really work with AWS. At that point, I hadn't discovered the AWS CLI yet, so I was primarily working with the browser console. I spent hours randomly clicking through the web GUI, confused with just about every AWS functionality. 

You can also probably imagine that by the beginning of December, I was a nervous wreck.  
I knew what AWS was...kind of.  
I knew what AWS did...kind of.  
I knew how to use AWS...kind of.  

When the day came for me to leave for YVR and fly to Vegas, I just said "screw it" and packed my bags. My mentality was whatever could or would happen at this conference, I would let future me deal with. 

End of Part I. Thanks for reading! 

Part II is going to be about my arrival to the conference and the moments leading up to the actual event. If you have any comments or thoughts, please feel free to contact me though LinkedIn or email!
